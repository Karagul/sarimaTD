Description: A set of wrapper functions around the forecast package to simplify
    estimation of and prediction from SARIMA models.  Estimation and prediction
    routines are provided for a "default" sarima model specification that we
    have found through experimentation that works fairly well for several
    infectious disease data sets.  In this specification, incidence data are
    first transformed to approximate normality, then seasonal differencing is
    performed, and the transformed data are passed to forecast::auto.arima for
    model selection and estimation.  A function to recursively simulate
    "trajectories" of future incidence is provided, based on functionality
    in the forecast package.
